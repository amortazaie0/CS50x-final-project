I am Amirali and this is my CS50 final project.

#### the languages that I used are:
- python for server side using flask framework
- html, CSS, and JavaScript
- SQLite for managing the databases
<hr>
This app is a TODO website. Via this web application, you can manage your daily tasks and organise them. You can also have your tasks as groups. This helps you to find your tasks faster.

### Database:
#### in database.db there are 3 tables:
1. users
2. tasks
3. types


You need to first login to your account, or, if you do not have one you need to register.
When you register, in the server side, the app stores the details that you have entered, but it just stores the hash of your password which is more secure.


in users table all the users information stored.
>- username
>- email
>- name
>- hashpass \
>   hashpass is the encrypted version of the password that is generated by the generate_hash_pass function

#### Login:
when we login, server searchs in the users table and look for the user_name entered and if it founds one, checks the password by using check_hash_pass function.

If there were no match, server will redirect you to the login route with an error message.

#### Change password:
You can change your password using a button in the navbar(after login), when you click on it, you'll redirect to the /changepass route, and it requires you to enter the new password, after submitting you will redirect to the main route and your password is changed.
\
when you change your password, server uses the users database and searches for the user_id, using your session. then it generates a hash of the password that you've entered and replace it by the last password in the users table.
\
Then you'll receive an email which confirms the change of your password.

>The app email you by doing any of these operations:
>- registering a new account
>- changing password


After logging in, you can start using this app by adding your tasks.
> you can specify:
> - date of the task
> - time of the task
> - task group or type of the task

#### Adding a task:
when you go to the main route, a form appears. In the first look its only one element, name. but when you start typing other options will come out using an [animation](#####animation)
\
you can select the date and tme for your task and select a task group.
\
by default there is only one task group or type called <b>main</b>.
if you want to add another one, you can click on the add new type button.
\
then a modal pups up and you have to enter the type name. then you'll redirect to the /ntype route and in there some operations happens.
server will insert to the types database another row, it'll get user_id from session on your browser and typename from the name that you've entered.
\
then you'll redirect to the main route again and by opening the types select menu, you can see that the new type has been added.

for deleting a type you can click on the delete type button, and a modal pups up again, you have to chose a type from a select menu and then click on the delete button.
then you'll redirect to the /dtype route.
server will delete the type with that name and user_id and then redirects you to the main route. now you can't see that type anymore.


##### animation:
I added some animation using css and JavaScript.

#### task operations:
After adding a task, you can delete it, and mark it as done or to-do, by checking the checkbox.

##### deleting a task:
>I used jinja loop to show tasks.
> \
> When you see a task after adding it, it is actually a form and the submit button of that form is delete button.
> \
> there is a hidden input called id, its value is the task_id.
>  when you click on the delete button, or better to say submit, it will send the user_id as a request to the /delete route, using "post" method.

when you click on the delete button, you'll redirect to the /delete route.
\
Then, server delete that task using task_id that it has been given to as a request, from the tasks table

#### checking tasks:
by checking a task, it redirects you to the /check route which takes the task id and change the status of it in the database.
after that you'll redirect to the main route again and as I used jinja syntax, I added an extra if which says:
\
<code>if task["status"] == "DONE"{
\
change checkbox to that task as field}
\
else:{
\
change it to empty}
