<hr>
This app is a TODO website, via this web application you can add your tasks and organise your life, you can add a task group that helps you to find your tasks faster.

You should first login to your account or if you don't have one you should register, then in the server side, it stores the details that you gave to it, but for password it stores the hash of it which is more secure.

then you can start using this app by adding your tasks.
> you can specify:
> - date of the task
> - time of the task
> - and task group or type
